This was my first project diving deep into tutorials and articles about CSS Grid. I also experimented with a CSS variables. Although the UI is simple and was quick to set up, I think it's very asthetically pleasing. :)  

The Javascript side was the focus of this project (and was the most challenging part). Working with event listeners is fairly new to me, but I was able to grasp these concepts with the help of some good online resources. 

Overall, I enjoyed working on this project. I definitely learned a lot of useful skills that'll set me up for success with future projects.
